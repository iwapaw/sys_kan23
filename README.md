### What is KANBAN? ###

Kanban is a method for managing the creation of products with an emphasis on continual delivery while not overburdening the development team. Like Scrum, Kanban is a process designed to help teams work together more effectively. 

Kanban is based on 3 basic principles:

* Visualize what you do today (workflow): seeing all the items in context of each other can be very informative
* Limit the amount of work in progress (WIP): this helps balance the flow-based approach so teams don't start and commit to too much work at once
* Enhance flow: when something is finished, the next highest thing from the backlog is pulled into play

Kanban promotes continuous collaboration and encourages active, ongoing learning and improving by defining the best possible team workflow.
